# Brick-Dodger
Brick Dodger is a high-octane 2D arcade game built with Flutter and Flame. Players control a character dodging randomly spawning bricks that fall at increasing speeds. Featuring smooth delta-time animations, power-ups like shields and slow-mo, and "near-miss" scoring, it blends addictive gameplay with polished visual "juice" for a premium feel.
